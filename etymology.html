	<h1><b>Etymology</b></h1>	
			<p>The name "Bull shark" comes from the shark's stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, unpredictable behavior.[4] In India, the Bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambezi">Zambezi River</a> shark or just Zambi. Its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names, including Ganges River shark, Fitzroy Creek whaler, van Rooyen's shark, Lake Nicaragua shark,[5] River shark, Freshwater whaler, Estuary whaler, Swan River whaler,[6] Cub shark, and Shovelnose shark.[7]</p>

	<h2><b>Evolutionary disconnect</b></h2>
			<p>The Bull shark is a special case in evolutionary history. Some of its closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. The Bull shark's genus, <i>Carcharhinus</i>, is shared by the Sand Bar shark that is not capable of osmoregulation.[8] Bull sharks fall under the same family <i>Carcharhinidae</i> and even the same subclass <i>Elasmobranchii</i> as some River sharks. This in turn raises questions regarding the evolutionary pathway taken which has resulted in the present day organism. In a rather less hypothetical variant of the clichéd "Chicken or Egg?" paradox, researchers face a similar question, but one which may well be answered definitively through further research. These questions can be pared down to: "Is it a River shark turned to the sea? Or a Sea shark turned towards the river?" The Bull shark has much in common with River sharks, Glyphis, and its own genus of Carcharhinus, but the evolutionary question still stands: where exactly did this shark come from, and when?[9] Much more evolutionary evidence is needed to draw a sound conclusion of the Bull shark's phylogeny.</p>

	<h2><b>Anatomy and appearance</b></h2>
			<p>Bull sharks are large and stout, with females being larger than males. The Bull shark can be up to 81 cm (2.66 ft) in length at birth.[10] Adult female Bull sharks average 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long and typically weigh 130 kg (290 lb), whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages 2.25 m (7.4 ft) and 95 kg (209 lb). While a maximum size of 3.5 m (11 ft) is commonly reported, there is a questionable record of a female specimen of exactly 4 m (13 ft). The maximum recorded weight of a Bull shark was 315 kg (694 lb) but may be larger.[3][11][12] Bull sharks are wider and heavier than other Requiem sharks of comparable length, and are grey on top and white below. The second dorsal fin is smaller than the first. The Bull shark's caudal fin is longer and lower than that of the larger sharks, and it has a small snout, and lacks an interdorsal ridge.[10]</p>

			<p>Bull sharks have a bite force of up to 5,914 newtons (1,330 lbf), weight for weight the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes.[13]</p>

	<h2><b>Distribution and habitat</b></h2>
			<p>The Bull shark is commonly found worldwide in coastal areas of warm oceans, in rivers and lakes, and occasionally salt and freshwater streams if they are deep enough. It is found to a depth of 150 metres (490 ft), but does not usually swim deeper than 30 metres (98 ft).[14] In the Atlantic, it is found from Massachusetts to southern Brazil, and from Morocco to Angola. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa to Kenya, India, and Vietnam to Australia.[citation needed]</p>

			<p>Populations of Bull sharks are also found in several major rivers, with more than 500 Bull sharks thought to be living in the Brisbane River. One was reportedly seen swimming the flooded streets of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, during the Queensland floods of late 2010/early 2011.[15] Several were sighted in one of the main streets of Goodna, Queensland, shortly after the peak of the January 2011, floods.[16] A large Bull shark was caught in the canals of Scarborough, just north of Brisbane within Moreton Bay. There are greater numbers still in the canals of the Gold Coast, also in Queensland.[17] In the Pacific Ocean, it can be found from Baja California to Ecuador. The Bull shark has traveled 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) up the Amazon River to Iquitos in Peru[18] and north Bolivia.[1] It also lives in fresh water Lake Nicaragua, in the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers of West Bengal and Assam in Eastern India and adjoining Bangladesh.[citation needed] It can live in water with a high salt content as in St. Lucia Estuary in South Africa. The Bull shark is generally prolific in the warm coastal waters and estuarine systems of the Mozambique Channel and Southward, including Kwa-Zulu Natal and Mozambique.[citation needed] The species has a distinct preference for warm currents.[citation needed]</p>

			<p>After Hurricane Katrina, many Bull sharks were sighted in Lake Pontchartrain.[19] Bull sharks have occasionally gone up the Mississippi River as far upstream as Alton, Illinois.[20] They have also been found in the Potomac River in Maryland.[21][22] A golf course lake in Queensland, Australia is the home to several Bull sharks. They are believed to have become trapped following a flood in the 1990s. The golf course has capitalized on the novelty and now hosts a monthly tournament called the "Shark Lake Challenge."[23]</p>
